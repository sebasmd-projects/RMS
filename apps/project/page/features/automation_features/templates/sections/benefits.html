           <p>In the property management business, when you think about data, you think about knowing your customers. Where they are, who they are, and most importantly how you can catch their attention. </p> 

            <p> Think about it: If a hotel manager doesn’t know who their customers are and where they’re coming from, then they have no idea how they should be marketing their hotel. </p> 

           <h5> This is the importance of data for your PMS in 2020.  </h5>
