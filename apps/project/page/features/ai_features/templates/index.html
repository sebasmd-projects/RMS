                humans – it performs tasks humans can’t achieve easily.

                    Being a computerized application, Einstein Analytics is
                    non-biased in its reports on deals. It’s not sentimental on
                    facts, it tells you the truth about your current position,
                    and by analyzing recent statistics, tells you what you can
                    do to improve it.

                Einstein Analytics helps you look outwards. It shows you a broad
                view of the competitive landscape, where it tracks win rates,
                and learn why deals were successful or not. It uses the almost
                hidden data in your business to spot trends and opportunities
                for you to take advantage of.

                Einstein Analytics helps businesses build deeper relationships
                with customers. This is a major break for service-based
                enterprises like hotels, where guests experience is of great
                importance. Einstein Analytics provides a 360-degree view in
                order to improve guests’ experience. This 360-degree view
                provides the hotels with relevant information they need to
                effectively manage their day-to-day interactions with guests.
